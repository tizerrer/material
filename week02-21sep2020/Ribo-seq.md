### Short summary
Ribo-seq (also known as ribosome profiling) is the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. This is possible since nucleases destroy exposed mRNA (i.e. ribosomes-free mRNA segments). Deep sequencing produces a snapshot of all the the active ribosomes at that moment and what they are translating. It extends the method of ribosome footprinting and allows study of (in-vivo) cellular
translation and its regulation.

### Examples of applications
Ribo-seq —> Measure differential gene expression at the level of mRNA
translation —> Poisson models/Fisher's exact test/ Likelihood ratio
test
Ribo-seq —> Map sites of translation initiation —> Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) algorithm
